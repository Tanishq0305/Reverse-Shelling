# Reverse-Shelling

1. Reverse shell program in Python for Windows program which will connect with the target device and through CLI attacker machine will be able to navigate and download files from target PC.
2. Use the IP address of the attacker machine if the target is connected via LAN.
3. Remember the chosen port shouldn't be used for any other application or process.
4. If target is not on the same network then use port forwarding. 

Happy ethical hacking :)
